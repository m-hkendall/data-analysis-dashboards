## Projects
### Wildfire Analysis Project Dashboard
###### Description: 
Using Canadian National Fire Database wildfire point data from 1930-2021 acquired from the [Canadian Wildland Fire Information System Datamart](https://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/datamart), I conducted an analysis of over 400,000 entries of wildfires logged by provinces, territories, and Parks Canada. I produced 6 charts to quantify Canadian wildfire activity dating back 50 years, including analyses of wildfire size, the wildfire season, wildfire locations, wildfire causes, and area burned per year.
###### Tools used:
